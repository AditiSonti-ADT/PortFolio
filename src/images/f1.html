						<p>Outsourcing is full of mediocre work, frustration and broken promises, but it doesn't have to be that way. A strong customer focussed approach and 15+ years of web development experience do make a difference.</p>
						<p>Good clients don't want cheap, they want good. When you work with me, you can expect high quality results, clear and ethical communication, attention to detail, an eye for aesthetics, and a personalised, professional and friendly service.</p>

										<p class="quote">Ivan is an outstanding developer. He takes time to plan and think through the best way to accomplish each task. He takes longer to get coding, but the result is far better and more stable code. I was pleasantly surprised each time that he went back and refactored the code (made it easier to read, easier to update, and easier to maintain). I wholeheartedly endorse Ivan for work in Wordpress, database development, HTML, Jquery, MySQL and PHP. He is a great person, a great coder, and a pleasure to work with.</p>

He followed the brief, was creative enough to quickly interpret my needs and the proof was in the Wordpress website he helped set up. He was also personable, available to answer queries when needed, and didn't just do the job but educated me as to why something needed to be done, I always felt that I was dealing with an honest and creative person and have no qualms in hiring, Ivan for future work.</p>

When Ivan joined our team that assembled a groupware collaboration product for franchise management and lead generation, he was able to thoroughly demonstrate how important it is to select the right personnel - i.e. the ones that are thorough, stay focussed when under pressure and able to clearly see the big picture even when involved in the minute details. Our system included CRM, calendar, addressbook, helpdesk, project management, notes, instant messaging, etc. Its success was largely due to having the right team.</p>

								<p>I have over 20 years of hands-on experience as a software developer, interface designer, systems analyst and business consultant. I possess strong skills in a number of development, markup and presentation languages, including PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Visual Basic, VBS, C, C++, Perl, Shell, AWK, and SQL.</p>
								<p>I also have extensive and real world business experience with a number of database management systems, including MYSQL, Postgress, Oracle, SQL Server, Ingress, Access, Universe, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_operating_system" title="Pick was the original multivalued database system">Pick</a>.</p>
								<p>I'm an outspoken advocate of the importance of software usability, web standards-driven and accessible design, and I strongly believe that user interfaces should be intuitive and simple to use.</p>
								<p>I have personally <a href="https://github.com/lutrov?tab=repositories">written a number of Wordpress plugins</a> over the years and have contributed to several popular Wordpress projects on <a href="https://github.com/lutrov">Github</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/13640">Woocommerce</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Strategy11/formidable-forms/issues/24">Formidable Forms</a>, <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/members/issues/96">Members</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/sensei/issues/1319">Sensei</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wpninjas/ninja-forms/issues/1109">Ninja Forms</a>. From time to time, I also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3827780/lutrov?tab=answers">contribute</a> to the web design and development community on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3827780/lutrov?tab=profile">Stack Overflow</a> and help <a href="https://upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01cbc02c7a69011690/">Upwork</a> improve their platform for clients and freelancers.</p>
								<p>I live and work in Melbourne's beautiful <a href="https://visityarravalley.com.au/">Yarra Valley</a>, and in my spare time I'm into fishing, photography, music from the 70s, rustic cooking, good wine, and apparently I know "way too much" <a href="https://imdb.com/user/ur2019270/">about movies</a>.</p>
